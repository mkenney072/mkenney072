## Hi, I'm Matt!

I'm a Level III Honours Chemistry student at McMaster University with broad interests across organic, inorganic and polymer chemistry - especially polymer chemistry and its real-world applications. I am currently doing a research practicum in the Adronov Research group, in which I am working on the synthesis of DBCO, a strained cycloalkyne used for functionalization of conjugated polymers via click reactions. Prior to that, I carried out a project involving a multi-step synthesis of functionalized polyfluorene for use in various applications involving carbon nanotubes. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing video games, keeping up with various different sports (especially baseball, hockey, and MMA) and reading non-fiction.
